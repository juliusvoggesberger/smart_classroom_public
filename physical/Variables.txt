Environment:			VarName:			Description:
Outside temperature 		tempOut				Measured in C째
Inside temperature 		tempIn				Measured in C째
Cloudiness			clouds				Penalty for outside light, valued from 1-10
Light outside			lightOut			Measured in Lux
Light inside			lightIn				Measured in Lux, 250-500Lux is ideal
(Outside moisture		moistureOut)
(Inside moisture		moistureIn)
Time 				time				Date + time
Lesson times			lessonTime			Given by starting time (Lessons are 90min)
Attendance			attendance			0-100% room fullness, or boolean

System variables:
Shutters state			shutters			0-100% open
Window state			windows				boolean
%% Radiatior state		radiator			boolean		  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Radiatior Temperature	radiatorTemp			temperature in C째 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
AC state			airCond				boolean		  
AC Temperature			airCondTemp			temperature in C째
Lamps state 			lamps				0-500 Lux



Sensors:			measures:
Light sensors 			lightIn
UV sensors			lightOut
Motion sensors			movement (boolean of movement in room, based on attendance)			Maybe: P(Movement) = max(min(1,3*attendance),previousMovement)
Temperature sensors		tempIn
Weather interface		tempOut, Cloudiness


Relationships:
lightOut = 10.000*clouds Lux									, If seasons are used summer=10, winter=1
lightIn = lightOut*shutters + lamps
tempIn = tempIn + (tempOut-tempIn)*windows*dif + (airCond-tempIn)*dif					, dif is a system constant that explains convergence speed, i.e. dif=1 means temperature instantly converges
